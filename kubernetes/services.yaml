# ClusterIP service is only accessible from within the cluster
# NodePort exposes the service on a port on each node in the cluster
# LoadBalancer service exposes the service externally using a cloud provider's load balancer.

# For now, since web app and api are public facing (called by the browser), we will use NodePort
